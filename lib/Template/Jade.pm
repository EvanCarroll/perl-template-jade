Parse Jade Markup L<http://jade-lang.com/>

		use Template::Jade qw(:all);
		
		my $html = render_file(
			'file.jade'
			, { TEMPLATE => { pageTitle => 'foo' }
		};

		my $html = render(
			$jade_string
			, { TEMPLATE => { pageTitle => 'foo' }
		);

		my $compiled_sub = compile(
			$jade_string
		);
		$compiled_sub->( { TEMPLATE => { pageTitle => 'foo' } );

Want an example of Jade Markup?

	doctype html
	html(lang="en")
		head
			script(type='text/javascript').
				if (foo) {
					bar(1 + 5)
				}
		body
			h1 Jade - node template engine
			#container.col
				if youAreUsingJade
					p You are amazing
				else
					p Get on it!
				p.
					Jade is a terse and simple
					templating language with a
					strong focus on performance
					and powerful features.

=head1 EXPORT

To sent a variable to the template, write to the hash B<$options-E<gt>{TEMPLATE}>

=head2 compile( $source, $options )

Compiles and returns a subroutine, called with options.

=head2 render( $source, $options )

Renders from scalar returning the markup.

=head2 render_file( $filename, $options )

Renders from file returning the markup.

=head1 DOCUMENTATION

Please view L<http://jade-lang.com/> for the official documentation.

Most of Jade is working: includes, blocks, conditionals, extends, inline tags,
implicit divs, comments (buffered and unbuffered), etc.

=head1 SUPPORTED OPTIONS

In calls to L<render_file>, L<render>, and L<compile> the following options are
always valid,

=over 4

=item compile_debug

Outputs the body of the function to be compiled, pre-compilation.

=item fh_output

Alternatively feed a filehandle and Template::Jade will write directly to it.

=back

=head1 CAVEATS

There are a few things not yet implimented.

=over 4

=item * Native Jade looping constructs

=item * Prepend/append block constructs

=item * Mixins -- compiled subroutines in the context of the parent.

=item * Non :markdown filters

=item * Array-set attributes a(href=@classes)

=item * Only supports HTML5

=back

Also, all code constructs (starting with '-' executes Perl not JavaScript).
